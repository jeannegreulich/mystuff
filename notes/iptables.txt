if iptables is not removing or changing entries you need to et precise match.

For some reason it does a count of types to quicken things  and if all you are doing is changing the port it won't relize it needs to be changed.

You can also flush all the rules and it will then recreate them correctly but setting the precise match parameter will always do it but it is slower.
